# What is Emacs

Emacs is a text editor, graphical text editor but can be used as terminal base editor with plenty of functionality and features Emacs usually compete with Vim for which one is the best text editor, i was using (neo)vim also back then before made my mind to migrate using emacs, here's some features why i switch to Emacs from Neovim

## Org Mode & Org agenda

Org mode is a mode that you can write, evaluate or do some basic stuff of writing anything you want, for example i'm using emacs and org mode to tracking my exercise / gym routinek, evaluate codeblock using `org-babel` and have the executed result automatically , and also for __TODO__ lists with schedule and deadline to remind me when this or that project is start and end, there's plenty usecases for using org mode that you can explore by yourself

## Graphical interface

Since Emacs is not terminal-based application, the customization is not limited like terminal-based application that can be deprecated easily with just using different terminal emulator, and also font lignature like `Fira Font Retina` is working extremely fine since Emacs is not depend on any terminal client that support lignature font

## Cross platform

You can run Emacs in any OS either you're Windows user or Mac user or maybe you're a _lunatic_ person who code in Android device it's also work fine using application called __Termux__ terminal emulator in android (well, back then i do programming in my android phone also hahaha)

## Plugin manager

Another reason i switch to Emacs from neovim is neovim doesn't have a place that contains plugins, emacs in the other hands have plugin marketplace called `Melpa`, so i can easily install plugin without search and clone t like neovim

# Conclution

Either you're Emacs or vim user if it's makes your job hardeer or slower that's mean it's doesn't matter which text editor you pick you only being a burden to your team //joking

both of the text editor had their own pros an cons, like Emacs, the default are suck that if you using the default keybind it's might be causing [Emacs pinky](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52492/what-is-the-best-way-to-avoid-getting-emacs-pinky)

Anywhay the only reason i switch to Emacs is the dashboard and in dashboard i can put any picture i desire like this!
