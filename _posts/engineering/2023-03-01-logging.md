# Logging

_Every good piece of sofware should have logger in it_ that's what they said, the importance of logging are many! it could save your time debugging your application and it could trace which function or method that caused bug! anyway what is logging? Logging is the process of recording events and data in a system or application. It is an essential aspect of software development and operations, providing critical information that can be used to troubleshoot and debug issues, improve performance, and meet compliance requirements and on this post i will explaining pros and cons of logging

## Pros of Logging

Like i mention earlier, logging can speed up your workflow when developing or debugging an piece of software, and it's not just limited to tracking bugs or error, it can also track your payload or checking what did you receive or send, here's some pros of logging

1. Troubleshooting and Debugging
One of the primary benefits of logging is that it provides valuable information for troubleshooting and debugging. When an error occurs, log data can help developers quickly identify the cause of the issue and determine how to fix it. Logs can provide insights into the sequence of events leading up to an error, as well as the values of key variables and parameters at different stages of the program's execution.

2. Performance Optimization
Logging can also be used to improve system performance. By monitoring the execution of a program and measuring key metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rates, developers can identify bottlenecks and other performance issues. This information can then be used to optimize the system and improve overall efficiency.

3. Compliance and Security
In many industries, compliance with regulatory requirements is essential. Logging can be used to meet these requirements by recording data and events in a way that can be audited and tracked. Additionally, logging can be used to detect and respond to security threats by monitoring system activity and identifying anomalous behavior.

4. Operational Insights
Logs can provide valuable insights into the operation of a system or application. By analyzing log data, developers and operations teams can gain a better understanding of how the system is being used, where issues are occurring, and how users are interacting with the application. This information can be used to improve the user experience and optimize the system's functionality.

5. Historical Analysis
Finally, logging can be used for historical analysis. By storing log data over time, developers can track changes and trends in the system's behavior, identify patterns and correlations, and make informed decisions about future development and optimization efforts.

In conclusion, logging is a critical aspect of software development and operations. By providing valuable data and insights, logging can be used to troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, meet compliance requirements, and improve the user experience. For these reasons, it's essential to implement effective logging strategies in any software project.

## Cons of Logging

Where there's good there's bad like yin and yang, even though logging can speed up your development time comes with some potential drawbacks

1. Performance Overhead
One of the primary concerns with logging is the potential performance overhead. Logging can be resource-intensive, and the process of recording events and data can slow down a system or application. This can be especially problematic in high-traffic systems or in situations where real-time performance is critical.

2. Storage Requirements
Logging can also result in significant storage requirements. Depending on the volume of data being logged and the retention policies in place, log files can quickly accumulate and consume significant amounts of disk space. This can be especially challenging for organizations with limited storage resources or for systems with high data volumes.

3. Security Risks
Logging can also create security risks, particularly if sensitive information is being logged. If log files are not appropriately secured or if they are accessible to unauthorized users, they can expose sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other confidential information. This can result in data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.

4. Complexity
Logging can also add complexity to a system or application. As logging requirements become more sophisticated, the code required to implement them can become more complex, leading to potential issues with maintainability and scalability. Additionally, as the volume of log data grows, it can become more challenging to manage and analyze, leading to potential errors or omissions.

5. False Sense of Security
Finally, logging can create a false sense of security. While logging can provide valuable insights into system behavior, it does not guarantee that the system is secure or functioning as intended. It is essential to combine logging with other security measures, such as access controls, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing, to ensure comprehensive protection.

In conclusion, while logging can be a powerful tool for troubleshooting, optimization, compliance, and security, it is essential to consider the potential drawbacks as well. By weighing the pros and cons of logging and implementing best practices for logging management, organizations can ensure that they are using this valuable tool effectively and efficiently.


## Conclusion

Logging is good for application but it's need very careful handling, if it's any crucial data logged there will be a thread for the application, i would suggest to not _reinvent the wheel_ it's need deep discussion between the engineer which part should we log and don't, and also since logger is kind of crucial part, i would suggest to not using third party logger package, use your programming language logging package and create _log wrapper_ from it.
