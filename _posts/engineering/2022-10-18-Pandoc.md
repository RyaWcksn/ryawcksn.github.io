Simplicity of writing document with Latex, Markdown and Pandoc
{: .message}

As an Engineering student we may or should write some Scientific Writing, Report, or Thesis. Usually we're using MS Word or LibreOffice Writer for get the job done, but, did you ever think like why should we re-align every the pages, spending time to make automatic ToC creation, do some __Click Click__ to show Math Equation, Creating Title page everytime we want to make Scientific Writing, why not creating one template and do the job without any unnecessary realign the layout and focus on the content we write, LaTeX is the answer!

# Document word processing

## LaTeX

What is _Latex_? Latex or often stylized as LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is available as free software.

For first timer, Latex may little bit weird and hard to approach since the syntax kinda weird like this

```latex
\begin{document}

\begin{titlepage}
    \pagenumbering{gobble}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{figure}
            \begin{center}
            % Logo
                \includegraphics[width=2.5cm]{$logo$}
            \end{center}
        \end{figure}
        \vspace*{0cm}
        \textbf{$campus$} \\
        \textbf{$title$} \\[1.0cm]
        \vspace*{2.5cm}
        \textbf{$type$} \\
        \vspace*{3 cm}       
        \textbf{$author$} \\
        \textbf{$studentnumber$} \\
        \vspace*{5.0cm}
        \textbf{
            FAKULTAS $faculty$ \\
            PROGRAM STUDI $major$ \\
            $city$
        }
    \end{center}
\end{titlepage}
\pagenumbering{roman}
\setcounter{page}{2}

$for(include-before)$
    $include-before$
$endfor$

$if(toc)$
{
    \hypersetup{linkcolor=black}
    \tableofcontents
}
$endif$

$if(toi)$
    \hypersetup{linkcolor=black}
    \listoffigures
$endif$

$if(tot)$
    \hypersetup{linkcolor=black}
    \listoftables
$endif$


\newpage
\pagenumbering{arabic}

$body$
\end{document}

```

Weird right? but don't get overwhelmed by the syntax, in this post i will simplify the Latex and word processing using Markdown and Pandoc

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.[9] Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

Markdown can be use as Latex content, the simplicity of Markdown makes the complicated Latex and word processing more efficient yet more faster since doesn't need to set margin nor padding of paging

Why i choose Markdown as content page for my document word processing? the answer is it's really simple, here's some guide to write using markdown (PS. this blog posts also written in Markdown)

In conventional word processor when we want to add some heading usually we're clicking some of tool bar and pick which heading we want, doesn't that take a time to grab the mouse and do some click click then back to keyboard?

In Markdown we just using `#` to make first header, `##` second header and vice versa, isn't more efficient and fast?, we can also use listing using `-` or numeric `1.`, quoting also simple `> Some quotes`

Here's the example

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

- List 1
- List 2
- List 3

1. List 1
2. List 2
3. List 3

> Quotes

> This is
> Multiple line
> Quotes

`some code here`

``go \\ use 3 backtick for codebloc
package main

import fmt

func main() {
        fmt.Println("This is codeblock")
    }
``
```

It's should be shown like this

- List 1
- List 2
- List 3

1. List 1
2. List 2
3. List 3

> Quotes

> This is
> Multiple line
> Quotes

`some code here`

```go
package main

import fmt

func main() {
        fmt.Println("This is codebloc")
    }
```

For more guide and best practice of using Markdown, here's very useful website to learn Markdown [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

## Pandoc

Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to another, and a command-line tool that uses this library.

Pandoc  can  convert  between  numerous markup and word processing formats, including, but not limited to, various flavors of Markdown, HTML, LaTeX and Word
docx.  For the full lists of input and output formats, see the --from and --to options below.  Pandoc can also produce PDF output

Pandoc's  enhanced  version of Markdown includes syntax for tables, definition lists, metadata blocks, footnotes, citations, math, and much more

To install Pandoc  

Ubuntu : `sudo apt install pandoc`  
For other distro can use their own package manager

I assume that Brew in already installed in the machine  
MacOS : `brew install pandoc`

For using Pandoc there's plenty of way, here's the basic 

```bash
// Direct convert from Markdown to PDF
pandoc -o output.pdf input.md

// For using default template or your own custom template
pandoc --template template.tex -o output.pdf input.md
```

## Conclusion

It's may take a time to configure template as you like and learn some Pandoc and Markdown manuals, but when you already learn the basic, the rest of them is piece of cake

Here's my repository of Markdown, Latex and Pandoc template for creating report [GITHUB](https://github.com/YuuriyaDev/pandoc-latex-markdown)
