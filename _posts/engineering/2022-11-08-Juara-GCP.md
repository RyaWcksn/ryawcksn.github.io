Cloud Engineering!
{: .message}

Some of you already know what is GCP, some aren't, well i'll explain as simple as i can, GCP stand for Google Cloud Platform which is a platform for engineers to easily develop their applications, there are many types of services that engineer could use, for me, i'm using Big Query, Cloud Run, Cloud Functon, Compute Engine, and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), now you already know what is GCP, let's start to main topic

## What is #JuaraGCP?

So [#JuaraGCP](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23JuaraGCP) is a event held in Indonesia (i didn't know if there's any kind of events like this out there) focuses in Cloud and Machine learning idea, usually this event held every year in Indonesia  

What will we get when participate in this event? first we will get 1 month pass to learn anything you want in Qwiklabs, also there's a Quest in the event, if you're able to reach the quests target before the event end, you will be get some SWAGS from Google! isn't that interesting!? anyway the reason i participate in this event is to learn something new in Cloud Engineering stuff (lie, actually i want the T-Shirt!)

This event held between 8 November until 4 December, you can register here [JuaraGCP](http://goo.gle/JuaraGCP)
