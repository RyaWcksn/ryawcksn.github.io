Some open source apps that i can't live without
{: .message}

# Open source app

What is Open Source App? well in short Open Source App or commonly known as *Floss* (Free Libre Open Source Software) is an app that the code base are open and not secret like any other non FLOSS apps, so everyone can see how the code works inside the app, validate if it's collecting personal data using telemetry to personal or corporate, or as simple as verify that the app isn't an malware

## Usecases of open source app

For me open source app is an alternative solution for close source and paid app, or app that isn't available on serveral operating system, such as FreeBSD or GNU/Linux (the reason i choose why i'm using open source app is because i'm using Arch Linux)

There's plenty of open source app out there but i will write down the best apps that can get the job done!

## Android app

Let's start from Android apps, first of all why i'm using Android instead of iOS? the answer is simple Android kernel based on Linux yet Android is an open source OS that you can do basically anything on it, contrary with iOS that close source OS

Enough with OS argument, let's continue with the apps

### 1. Browser

Browser is an app that mostly everyone use in this days, people search anything through browser, doing some jobs using browser, so basically browser is like OS inside a OS, browser is just like digital book into your mind, if your search history or download history exposed to public, everyone can know what kind of person are you, so browser that respect user privacy and security is a must nowadays so i will introduce you to 2 browsers that i use daily basic

- Bromite

Bromite is a browser based on [Chromium project](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) with ad blocking and privacy enchantment, the interface is similliar with Chrome with some additional security patches, you can check the source code at [Github](https://github.com/bromite/bromite), this browser really recommended for you security enthusiast and normies that doesn't really into security things

- Tor browser

Tor browser, a well-known browser by anyone, based on Firefox browser with extra security and anonymity patches that makes this browser is really secure for you who seek extra security, you can get the Tor browser at [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/)

### 2. Email client

Email client needs to be secure, perhaps, someone can peek into our precious mail that contains some company credentials or someting important

- K9 Mail

K9 Mail is secure yet lightweight email client that support variety of email domain, such as outlook, gmail, and custom mail like mine [pram.aryawcksn@yuuriya.tech](mailto:pram.aryawcksn@yuuriya.tech), the source code can be look at [Github](https://github.com/thundernest/k-9)

### 3. Terminal emulator

Terminal emulator, i know that phone doesn't need terminal just like desktop but sometimes it's convenient to have an terminal anywhere you go, or perhaps you might forgot to bring your laptop with you and need to do tweak dome config on your cloud machine, or just some simple change on blog that you write, so instead of get back to your house and get the laptop, why not just using your phone as "laptop"

- Termux

Termux is a Android terminal emulator that very similliar with Linux terminal emulator, with support of external keyboard either it's bluethoot or wired you can get the job done, or using android default virtual keyboard, termux can install basically anything just like on linux, you can do some SSH into cloud machine, edit some config using Vim or Emacs, or just simple ping the network, you can get the source code at [Github](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)

### 4. Keyboard

Keyboard is one of many vital apps on Android yet the most dangerous app, default Android keyboard can record what you type anonymously and send it to corporate to use it as big data

- Floris keyboard

Floris keyboard is a open source keyboard that doesn't record what you type and respect user privacy, it's still on development so not so many language available on this keyboard, other than that, some suggestion feature also isn't available yet on this keyboard, but it's worth to try, you can see the source code at [Github](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard)
