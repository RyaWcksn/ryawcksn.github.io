My effort to become polyglot!

First of all, why i choose Russian besides any other languages around the world? well the answer is i'm also learning Japanese, Germany and France. But currently i'm more into Russian, why? i want to read some ~~__REDACTED__~~ books

# Basic of Russian language

Just like any other non-latin alphabeth languages, i'd like to start with learn the alphabets in this case _Cyrillic_, yes, Russian writting system based on Cyrillic alphabet so that was a challenge for me to learn Russian, learn the alphabets first then the vocabularies, Russia have 33 alphabets compared to Indonesia and English who had 26 alphabets for more information just go to this [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script#Letters) i'm too lazy to write all of the alphabets hahaha

## What did i've achieved during this 7 days span?

Things that i've achieved in 7 days are i remember few vocabularies like __Доброе Утра__ (Good Morning) and __Добрый День__ (Good Afternoon) and simple sentence like __да, я говорю по Японский__ (Yes, I Speak Japanese), also i've improved some of Russian pronounciation like __Говорю__ even though it's written __Govoryu__ but reads as __Gavaryu__ The Russian letter O is pronounced [o] when it is stressed and it is pronounced like A [a] or an unclear schwa [ə] when it is not stressed. This is called vowel reduction, and it is an important rule of the Russian pronunciation, and __Привет__ it's read as __Privyet__ not __Privet__ even it's written like that, Russian "e" is pronounced "ye" in some cases (after vowels, soft and hard signs, beginning of words) but, more often than not, it's pronounced similarly to Spanish "e"

## What will i achieve in another 7 days?

My targets for 7 days ahead are capable of write simple Russian sentence with grammatical gender of Russian noun, and have a proper conversation with Russian people just like 3 years ago


What my main motivation to learn other language besides English and Mother language? It's simple i want to have friends around the world!
